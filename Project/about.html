                    <h3>one of the traveling benefits is finding and keeping humility. 
                    Too often, people get wrapped up in their lives, their daily routine of working, sleeping, eating and living.
                    They become self-absorbed to the point it affects their health, their happiness, and their perspective</h3>

                    <h3>travel reminds those paying attention that they are not the only ship in the sea, that this is a huge world and that they are only a small, insignificant pea in it. 
                        This is quite a humbling experience – to go to another country and see large numbers of peoples living differently, and coming to understand how large the crazy world actually is.
                        When people who learn return home, they keep with them this perspective for the rest of their life and they benefit from this is knowledge and perspective.</h3>
