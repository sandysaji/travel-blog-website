                    <p>If you are looking for great scenery and a great workout without all the technical difficulty of other trails, Northridge Loop is for you. 
                        The ridge runs east to west, with Ojai Valley on one side and Rose Valley on the other. The trail features amazing views of both valleys plus the Los Padres National Forest. </p>
                <p>There are a total of 6 trail heads spread out over the 14.5 mile loop, so there are plenty of places to get on or off the trail.
                    <strong>Hiking is permitting along all trails</strong>, so ride with caution and don't override your stopping power.</p>

                    <p>While the overall trail is fine for beginners, two spurs, Gridley and Pratt, are much narrower and technical, so be sure to check the signage before choosing a trail. </p>
                    <p>While there are no steep drops or bombs on this trail, there are several areas of the trail that extend over bare rock. The paths are marked, but there are canyon areas that you should be aware of. <em>Before starting any downhill section make sure you know the path!</em></p>

                    <p>It’s not the biggest, it’s not the highest, and it’s not the most technical trail in Ojai, but in my opinion, it’s the best. It has an amazing variety of surfaces and trail types, so much so that you really can say there is something for everyone on the Northridge. Check it out, and you’ll be taking your friends back up the trail over and over again. </p>

     <h1>Ojai Trail Facts</h3>
    <p>Ojai has over 200 miles of hiking and biking trails, with over 80 miles dedicated solely to mountain biking! Most trails border working farms or ranches, so please take the time to learn your route before going, and pay careful attention to trail markers. Ojai trails are mostly self maintained, so if you see a problem, try to fix it! If the problem is a large one, contact one of the local cycling clubs to let them know,each month they have a trail-repair day that is spent maintaining the trails you know and love!</p>
